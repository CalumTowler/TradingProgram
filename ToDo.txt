Text file for anyone involved to view and add required tasks.
Project is broken up into 3 phases; feel free to add tasks for a later phase as you think of them but please focus on the current
phases tasks primarily.

Phase 1 - Designing a program that is capable of pulling live stock data, converting it to a manipulatable format and performing numerical analysis on
large volumes of data. This will allow monitoring of many stocks whilst the human user is able to research that a computer cant (news headlines, etc..)

Phase 2 - Design a neural network that develops awereness of stock links (how stocks affect eachother), how the indicators work and which numerical
analyses to perform. Essentially teaches itself to do Phase 1 without hardcoding new input.

Phase 3 - Design a program that can actually buy/sell stocks based upon information gathered using Phase 2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1:
- Important Decisions:
    - Need to examine entire program structure - classes/functions/seperate programs.

- File Manipulation:
    - (Main Pulls and Manipulable Libraries - ???).
    - Generate 5min, 15min, 30min and 60min data from main pull (DONE but need to decide which function to use)
    - (Optimise current manipulable library code)
    - Hold all data as dictionaries rather than reading and writing.
    - Decide filestructure for 5-day data
    - Rewrite PL to have both time-index and original.

- Correlator:
    - All-Purpose Correlator: Correlates every two pairs of stocks - gets list of targets from directory names; DONE + Tested for 3 TICKERS. Larger testing needed.
    - Command-Line Correlator: Correlate chosen tickers.
    - Group Correlator: Calls specific groups of tickers to correlate; called with priority 1, 2 or 3.

- FFT:
    - FFT, clean and then IFFT.

- Plotting:
    - Bar/Histogram where width ipt (Is Proportional To) volume, bar ends are low/high and has line tracing close.

- Functions:
    - Need to start functions. Pandas has rolling and exponential weighted functions to do this - investigate what Alex wants.

- Data:
    - ETFs and shit should be available, get tickers of Alex and play.

- Housekeeping:
    - Refamiliarise with Git and sort out the repository.
    - Concat all obsolete files/methods into 1 file and delete rest.
